He'll be rich and famous, sing in Milan and Rome, and travel the world like a royal prince!" Pinza worked as a carpenter, and was a professional bicycle rider, his education was equivalent to about a sixth grade education, and he couldn't read a note of music. Pinza studied at the Bologna Conservatory, making his début as [Oroveso] Norma at Soncino, near Cremona (1914). After military service (1915-19), he began to sing in the principal Italian houses, notably at La Scala, under Toscanini (1922-1924). He was [Don Giovanni], he was [Figaro], he was [Emile de Becque] - off the stage as well as on. During the 1930s he appeared in five Covent Garden seasons, and by 1935, he had become an international star. He sang at the Salzburg Festival. After leaving the Metropolitan at the age of 56, he began a second career in musical comedy, operetta and musical films, scoring an enormous success on Broadway in South Pacific (1949). Pinza's beautiful and cultivated basso cantante, his handsome presence, engaging personality and spirited acting made him the most richly gifted and accomplished Italian bass of his day.
